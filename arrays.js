// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.

var myHeroes = ["Batman", "Wolverine", "Daredevil"];

document.write("My #1 superhero is " + myHeroes[0] + " my #2 superhero is " + myHeroes[1] + " and my #3 superhero is " + myHeroes[2] + "<br>");
